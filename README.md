This story represents where riders start and end thier trips using a heat map. We instantly see that the majority of the activity takes place in the center of New York City below Manhattan. The heat map above in blue represents where riders started thier trip. The Heat map below in red represents where riders ended thier trip.

Story 3 shows three visulisations. The first heat graph above represents the overall usage records by time of day throughout the week. 

The graph in the bottom left illustrates which days of the week are most active based on gender and user type. Darker blue signify higher usage. 

The pie chart on the bottom right gives the count of user types (subscribers vs. customers or non subscribers) 

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

In the first story we see that Citibikes were significatly used more by males across all genders. 5 minutes was the most common time duration for using the bike with 108,087 records by males and 34,151 records for females. 

Usage of Citibike throuhgout the week is fairly similar for Males and Females. The most popular times for renting a city bike is Monday at 6pm, Tuesday at 6pm, Thursday at 8am and 6pm. Thursday was the most popular day with the peak records for both male (30,749 records at 6pm) and Female (11,336 records at 6pm). 

Story 2 gives us the overview of where people take the citibike and drop off thier citibike. Its intersting to see that both maps look almost identical. This tells us that every Citibike station is used just as much as the others. Bikes are most active in and around Union Square and less closer to manhattan. This region could be skewed from the fact that there are more stations and inventory of bikes. 

The first heat graph in story 3 represents the overall bike usage startime trhoughout the week. Thursday at 6pm is the most popular time with 44,905 records. It worth noting that the data shows a consistant usage throuhgout the weekend on daytimes. We can suggest that the best time to repair the bikes would be in the early mornning on weekends. 

The two graphs visulisations below show information on how different user types compare. Based on the pie chart we see that there is significatly more subsribers to citibike. This information would be very useful to investors because higher subscriber count presents a healthy and lucrative business plan for the future. A significant amount of subscribers are males as expected. The most common day for subscriber use is Thrusday as expected.
