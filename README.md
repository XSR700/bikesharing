# NYC Citibike analysis


## Overview of the analysis:

Kate proposed an Idea to start a Citibike service in her hometown Des Moines, Iowa. She needs help presenting her idea to investors by analyzing the existing data from New York City. This analysis will extract the August data of Citibike users in New York and present analytics visualizations using Tableau Software. 

## Results:

Story 1 first graph shows the trip duration of city bike renters separated by gender.

The heat map graph below shows the most common time of day used by riders in a week. redder squares signify higher records.

This story represents where riders start and end their trips using a heat map. We instantly see that the majority of the activity takes place in the center of New York City below Manhattan. The heat map above in blue represents where riders started their trip. The Heat map below in red represents where riders ended their trip.

Story 3 shows three visualisations. The first heat graph above represents the overall usage records by the time of day throughout the week. 

The graph in the bottom left illustrates which days of the week are most active based on gender and user type. Darker blue signifies higher usage. 

The pie chart on the bottom right gives the count of user types (subscribers vs. customers or nonsubscribers) 

## Summary:

In the first story, we see that Citibikes were significantly used more by males across all genders. 5 minutes was the most common time duration for using the bike with 108,087 records by males and 34,151 records for females. 

Usage of Citibike throughout the week is fairly similar for Males and Females. The most popular times for renting a city bike are Monday at 6 pm, Tuesday at 6 pm, Thursday at 8 am and 6 pm. Thursday was the most popular day with the peak records for both males (30,749 records at 6 pm) and females (11,336 records at 6 pm). 

Story 2 gives us an overview of where people take the Citi bike and drop off the Citi bike. It's interesting to see that both maps look almost identical. This tells us that every Citibike station is used just as much as the others. Bikes are most active in and around Union Square and less active near manhattan. This region could be skewed from the fact that there are more stations and inventory of bikes. 

The first heat graph in story 3 represents the overall bike usage star time throughout the week. Thursday at 6 pm is the most popular time with 44,905 records. It is worth noting that the data shows a consistent usage throughout the weekend on daytimes. We can suggest that the best time to repair the bikes would be in the early morning on weekends. 

The two graphs visualizations below show information on how different user types compare. Based on the pie chart we see that there are significantly more subscribers to Citi bike. This information would be very useful to investors because a higher subscriber count presents a healthy and lucrative business plan for the future. A significant amount of subscribers are males as expected. The most common day for subscriber use is Thursday as expected. 

An additional visualization I would research is the average trip duration based on age. New York and Iowa age demographics would differ and it would be interesting to view the most common user age. 

I would also create a visualization focusing on subscribers. This would involve a dashboard demonstrating the same graphs above based on subscriber user type. This would include trip duration by subscriber, common subscriber age, and most popular places for subscribers.
